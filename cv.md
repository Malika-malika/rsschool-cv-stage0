Remote work as a retoucher gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development.
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

    let leftSum = arr.slice(0, i).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    
    let rightSum = arr.slice(i + 1).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    
    if (leftSum === rightSum) {
    
      return i;
      
    }
